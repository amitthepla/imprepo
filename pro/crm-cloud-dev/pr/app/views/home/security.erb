                Data that is transferred between your browser and our servers is encrypted using SSL. We work to maintain the highest standards for encryption and disable support for older encryption standards that are no longer considered strong. This is one reason that we drop support for older browsers aggressively.

                You choose who to invite to your WakeUpSales account and the permissions they have. Our team do not have access to login to your account. On rare occasions, it may be that we can better assist in investigating a problem you are having with WakeUpSales if we can access some part of your data in readable form. We would always ask your permission before taking this action and the process requires authorization and co-ordination across multiple personal and security layers internally.

                Our systems automatically replicate your data across multiple locations in real-time to maximize availability. In addition, data is further backed up hourly to ensure we can restore access to your data and the service in the unlikely event that all locations suffer complete failure. Our monitoring alerts us to any trouble and we have staff on-call at all times to quickly resolve unexpected incidents.
