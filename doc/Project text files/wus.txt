Girija Mam,

I have successfully fixed the blank filter issue in lead listing page and pushed to new remote branch "deal_filter_issue_fix". You can verify the changes and merge them to master branch.

But after fixing this issue, I have found couple of more issues as below,

Records are not being inserted correctly in Deal settings table
Checkbox validation is not working fine

I will work on this tomorrow and keep you posted.

Hi,

We need to setup Asterisk(version 11+) which is an open source framework for building communications applications that turns an ordinary computer into a communications server.

I found that Asterisk is best fit in Ubuntu which is also recommended by Asterisk. And also found that AsteriskNOW(http://www.asterisk.org/downloads/asterisknow)
is a package available that installs the operating system, Asterisk, drivers for Digium telephony cards and phones and an open source administrative user interface called FreePBX. This installation process if fully automated and takes roughly 20 minutes to convert a computer into a working phone system.

After installation please make sure to verify following stuffs,

Asterisk CLI is accessible with the following command
$> asterisk -rvvv

FreePBX is installed and working as expected
FreePBX is a web interface for our Asterisk configuration


Please keep me updated in this email thread on day basis about the progress.

Hi Amit,

When I try to do a normal Signup, or a Google or LinkedIn Signup - it does Signup correctly but I don't get any confirmation email neither in user inbox not in the support. 

Maybe that's the reason we're not able to know if somehas Signed-up in cloud. 

We need to fix and test this.

@ankeet test this once if this working.



Hi Omkar, 

I just signup in cloud and successfully received the email with temp. password(Attached). By looking at the code, I do not think we have the code in place to send an email notification to WUS Support. Let me talk to developers, and we can place this code on Monday. 

And on a separate note, about Google or LinkedIn Signup, if the email ID is already in WUS, then you will not get any confirmation mail, rather it will directly login and link Linkedin account with the given email ID. you can check this in settings page under "SNS media" tab.


Best,
Amit

Step-1: (Web form Creation)
	Click on settings icon from top header and click on "Manage Web Form"
	If there is no web form created yet it will redirect to create web form page else it will redirect to "Manage Web Form" listing page
	Fill out Form name, User Responsible and Lead Source these three fields are mandatory
	Click on "Create HTML For Your Website" link, then a pop up will appear
	In this pop up select fields name as per your choice, and the respective html code will reflect on text area below
	If you do not click "Create HTML For Your Website" or do not select any field then the default fields are First Name, Last Name and Email
	In "POST FORM SUBMISSION ACTIVITY" section, choose "Display a page on my website" or default form submission is "Display Thank you page"
	In "EMAIL NOTIFICATION SETTINGS" section check "Send Email Notifications To" and select option as per your requirement to get email notification
	After creating a web form all data are saved and it will redirect to "Manage Web Form" listing page
	You can get the previously submitted data in the top of the listing
	Click on "Get HTML Code" to show HTML code in a pop up
	Click on "Copy Text" to copy the HTML code below
	Create a HTML file and paste the copied text in to the file

Step-2: (Web form Submission from source side)
	Open the HTML file in a browser, then the form will open with your selected fields in part 1
	Fill out all the fields and submit the form
	An email will received according to your selection in "EMAIL NOTIFICATION SETTINGS" section in part 1
	And also an email will send to the user email

Step-3: 
	The data you have submit in part 2 will be inserted as a Lead and Contact 
	You can check it in Lead Listing page, Contact Listing page
	You will also get a new activity in Activity page






So how many issues has been fixed this week? and How many issue left?
What need to be done to expedite the issue fix asap?

Sir, we have already fixed major page break issues and pushed to production as well. Now overally we have UI/UX issues/enhancement listed in OS which we are trying to fix by Thursday EOD. We are giving our best effort to sort out the stuffs ASAP.

We have also started working on new form layout UI changes and already implemented for WebToLead. Gradually we will implement in other pages too.

Almost 50% of the issues has been resolved and we will take care of the rest by Thurday. From Monday we are also planning to start working on Lead project management. I have already discussed the same with Anurag Sir and Omkar.
